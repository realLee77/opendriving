This open source driving simulation platform is based on Dr Zhitao Xiong's PhD research, tilted "Creating a Computing Environment in a Driving Simulator to orchestrate Scenarios with Autonomous Vehicles". By utilizing an academic research-oriented framework and a soft body-based physics engine, OpenDriving is to provide a tool or test-bed with realistic physics and behaviours to any users, which can range not only from serious game players to academic researchers, but also from driving instructors to simulation developers. It can help entities ranging from individuals to agencies.

Update: I am now commercializing it so it is no longer an open source project. If you are interested in its commercialized version, please do not hesitate to contact me at xiongzhitao@gmail.com. We will make the final product ready in August this year (2015).
